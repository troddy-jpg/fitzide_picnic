* What makes an incremental game good?
** buildings with costs which rise at a greater rate than their contributions
* TODO design my game
** currency
*** material
**** falls from the hill as the boat scrapes along
*** distance
**** should be increasing
**** speed should be increasing
**** spent to upgrade pulley system
**** spending too much crashes the boat - don't let the autobuyers screw you over
*** people
*** money
*** motivation
*** blessing points
** sacrifice (prestige)
The gods of the zone are motivated by tribulation. The farther the boat moves before crashing back down the mountain, the more points you have to obtain blessings from the zone gods.
** blessings (talents)
Blessings change the decisions you make in regards to construction and unit allocation

** rope: pulls the boat using pulley
** golden orb: kills closest unit every minute
*** the boat is transporting this ?
** vehicle (need fuel and unit): attached to pulley
** log (assign units): cut trees ahead of boat. produces LOGS
** LOGS: currency
** clear mound (vehicle, units, fuel): flattens terrain
** tracks (flat terrain, LOGS, assign units): place tracks for boat to advance
** export logs (logs): +funding
** import fuel (funding): +fuel
